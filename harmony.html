        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>Harmony in the Wild is an open-world adventure where you play as a magical fox. You learn abilities from animal friends — gliding, swimming, smashing rocks, and more — as you uncover the story of a dying world brought back to life.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I worked on designing and programming the core game systems: movement mechanics, environmental interactions, and ability unlocking. A big focus was on seamless traversal and narrative integration.</p>

        <h2>Sample Code</h2>
        <pre><code>
// Example C# (Unity)
void SmashRock(Rock rock) {
    if (canSmash) {
        rock.Destroy();
        PlaySmashEffect();
    }
}
    </code></pre>
