                <p>Hi! My name is Zsombor Faragó, 4th year Game Production student studying in Finland. I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hungary. I specialize in Game Programming and Game Design, as well as any kind of problem solving.</p>
                <p>I love being in front of people and presenting or leading conversations. Video games have been my biggest hobby since I turned 4 years old, so I have quite a lot of experience when it comes to them. My favorite games currently include League of Legends, Terraria, Valorant, Life is Strange and lots of other diverse game titles that are absolutely brilliant.</p>
                <p>I’ve been studying programming for 6,5 years, mainly in C# and C++ languages. My strongest points are coding and game design, as well as organizational, communication and team work skills, I’m very interested in all of these, and I’m motivated to improve them further.</p>
